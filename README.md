# Danger Zone
Danger Zone is a mod about adding danger and excitement to Minecraft. I kept playing modpacks, getting awesome
armor and weaponry, but having nothing to kill with it. This mod changes the difficulty of various parts of
the Minecraft world making normal enemies a real challenge again, even if you have cool mod armor. But wait!
With great risk comes great reward, and the rewards are certainly great. Rare and special loot drops, extra
normal loot drops, and probably other things I haven't thought of yet.

### Summoning
When using `/summon` to summon an entity, its level may be modified by adding
`ForgeCaps:{"dangerzone:level":<LEVEL>}` to your data tag. Replace `<LEVEL>` with the desired
danger level of the entity.


# Status
This mod is absolutely a Work In Progress. This isn't even alpha. There are a lot of planned features, but
coding takes time.

# Modpack
Currently you may NOT use this mod in a modpack without explicit permission. I don't want people contacting
me about it until I've made an official release. Sorry about that.

# Copying
If you're looking at this mod because you want to learn how to make Minecraft mods, read on. This mod
is licensed under the GPLv3, meaning if you want to copy it then your code must be GPLv3 as well.

If you learn how to do something from reading my code, then make it work in your own code, that is fine.
You can license your own code however you want.

If you flat out copy my code and all you do is rename some variables, that's not okay, unless you
also release your code as GPLv3.
