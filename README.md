# Danger Zone
Danger Zone is a mod about adding danger and excitement to Minecraft. I kept playing modpacks, getting awesome
armor and weaponry, but having nothing to kill with it. This mod changes the difficulty of various parts of
the Minecraft world making normal enemies a real challenge again, even if you have cool mod armor. But wait!
With great risk comes great reward, and the rewards are certainly great. Rare and special loot drops, extra
normal loot drops, and probably other things I haven't thought of yet.

# Status
This mod is absolutely a Work In Progress. This isn't even alpha. There are a lot of planned features, but
coding takes time.
