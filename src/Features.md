# Overview
DangerZone makes the difficulty level vary based on your location.
As the difficulty increases so does mob health, mob damage, and
mob loot.

# Goals
- Dynamic difficulty based on world location
- Better loot based on mob difficulty
- Bosses and dungeons in difficult areas
- Provide a fun PvE experience when using modded armor and weapons
  from other mods

# Not-Goals
These are things I don't plan to add to the mod. They are interesting ideas,
but wouldn't work with the vision I have. 
- Leveling system - this is intended to make having extremely powerful
  armor interesting again, not to turn Minecraft into an RPG
