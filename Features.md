# Overview
DangerZone makes the difficulty level vary based on your location.
As the difficulty increases so does mob health, mob damage, and
mob loot.

# Goals
- Dynamic difficulty based on world location
- Better loot based on mob difficulty
- Bosses and dungeons in difficult areas
- Provide a fun PvE experience when using modded armor and weapons
  from other mods

# Non-Goals
These are things I don't plan to add to the mod. They are interesting ideas,
but wouldn't work with the vision I have. 
- Leveling system - this is intended to make having extremely powerful
  armor interesting again, not to turn Minecraft into an RPG
- 


# Structure Ideas
## Harpy Nest
A large tower with a flock of harpies at the top, suitable
for players with creative flight.

## Abandoned Tomb
A series of "fight rooms" where you have to fight groups of zombies protecting
the dead and the treasure buried there.

Bosses:
- Lich - undead sorcerer who controls zombies and uses magic
- General - A strong melee fighter with powerful armor and weapons

## Castle
A sprawling, above-ground building with many rooms and passageways. Some
terrible tragedy long ago bound the souls of its inhabitants here forever.

Enemies:
- Guard - An undead guard who will protect their lord for eternity.
  Has iron armor and weaponry.
- Elite Guard - An elite guard for the lord of the castle. Uses diamond
  weapons and diamond armor.
- Archer - They make approaching the castle difficult for the unprepared.
- Servant - A simple servant who wields a knife.

Bosses:
- Demon - In the depths of the castle, beneath a hidden passageway, some
  fool tried to summon a demon! To prevent its escape, the castle was cursed
  so none of the inhabitants could leave.
  - This spawns a castle with a secret lab underneath which contains the demon.
- Necromancer - This jerk took over the castle, killed the king, and now rules
  his undead minions with a skeletal fist!
- Cursed King - A king who was cursed by a witch! He probably deserved it.
  - Found in the throne room.

## Great Temple


## Catacombs

Bosses:
- Dead Hand - This is Dead Hand from Ocarina of Time. Not straight up, because that would be
  copyright infringement, but that's the general idea.
- 

## Witch Circle
Less of a dungeon and more of a standalone boss fight. You fight a group of extra-tough
witches. That's basically it.


## Whirlpool
An, initially small, whirlpool in the ocean. Once you get close a sea monster spawns!

Bosses:
- Whirlpool Kraken
- 

## Sunken City
It's R'leth. 

Bosses:
- Cthulhu
- Azathoh

## Fishing Village
This is basically Innsmouth. Under the village are caves filled with various non-euclidian
horrors. Deep in the caves you can find ritual circles, and potentially a portal to a boss
fight.

Ideas:
- You have a limited amount of time to interrupt a ritual. If you fail, you are immediately
  forced to fight the boss. If you succeed, then you can open a "weakened" portal, and
  the boss fight becomes easier.

Bosses:
- Cthulhu
- Azathoth
- Kraken
